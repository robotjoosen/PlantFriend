## Generate XBM files from BMP
Generating XBM files from BPMs can be done with the use of Imagick. With the following script that it can be done in bulk.

```zsh
â†’ magick mogrify -format xbm *.bmp
```

If you don't have (Image Magick)[https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/imagemagick] you can install this with (Homebrew)[https://brew.sh]. I have no idea how to do this with Windows...
